<h3>ns-2.35 Released on Nov 4, 2011</h3>
<ul>
<p><li><b>[mweigle]</b> Fri Aug 26 15:50:00 EDT 2011:
<br> Provide fixes to the Tmix traffic generator, mainly to the one-way 
TCP implementation, but some changes to the Full-TCP version as well.  Tmix 
with one-way TCP now performs comparably to Tmix with Full-TCP (albeit 
with longer running times and higher memory consumption). Includes 
contributions from David Hayes and DongXia Xu at 
<a href="http://caia.swin.edu.au">Swinburne</a> and relevant updates to the 
documentation and tests. More information is available at 
<a href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/inets/Tmix/">http://www.cs.odu.edu/inets/Tmix/</a>.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Sun May 9 18:28:00 EDT 2010:
<br> Add Marcello Caleffi's Multi-path Dynamic Address RouTing (M-DART) 
protocol.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Tue Apr  6 01:09:01 EDT 2010:
<br> Add Sidney Doria's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
implementation.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Sat Apr  3 16:40:13 EDT 2010:
<br> Added the SYN_immediate_ack flag so that a DelAckSink agent will 
immediately ACK the first (SYN) packet sent by a TcpAgent. The patch contains 
changes to tcp-sink.{cc,h}, ns-default.tcl, and affected validation tests. 
All validation tests that use the syn_ in TcpAgent were set to 
SYN_immediate_ack = false except for the delayed test in test-suite-simple.tcl. 
Patch from Michele Weigle.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Fri Apr  2 19:22:43 EDT 2010:
<br> During long simulations (30-60 minutes), ns would sometimes abort with the
message "TcpAgent: negative RTO!". The problem was that TcpAgent::t_backoff
_ was overflowing and becoming negative, since it was doubled each time a b
ackoff was triggered but maxrto_ prevented the time between doublings from
growing beyond 60 seconds.   Patch from Michele Weigle.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Fri Apr  2 15:58:25 EDT 2010:
This patch adds support for using one-way TcpAgents with the Tmix traffic g
enerator, which previously only worked with FullTcp agents.
This patch also includes the relevant updates to documentation (doc/tmix.te
x), examples (tcl/ex/tmix/text-tmix-oneway.tcl), and tests
(tcl/test/test-suite-tmix.tcl; tcl/test/test-output/tmix/).
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Fri Apr  2 15:53:56 EDT 2010:
<br> Protocol for Unified Multicasting Through Announcements (PUMA) 
has been added.  PUMA is a distributed, receiver initiated, mesh based 
multicast routing protocol.  It is documented in the "Mobile Networking in ns"
chapter in the ns-2 manual.  From Sidney Doria.
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Sun Nov 15 21:50:00 2009:
<br> A new SCTP patch from Nasif Ekiz and the University of Delaware team.
<ul>
<li> added support for Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR-SACK).
     To enable NR-SACKs, set useNonRenegSacks_ tcl bindable variable to 1 at
     both the data sender and the data receiver.
</li>
<li> Concurrent Multipath Transfer with Potentially Failed(CMT-PF) extension
     is default now. To use CMT, set useCmtPF tcl bindable variable to 0
     at the data sender.
</li>
<li> added new feature to support a limited size send buffer at the data
     receiver. Send buffer size can be specified by setting initialSwnd_ tcl
     bindable variable to desired value. By default, the variable is set to
     0 which means there is no constraint on the send buffer.
</li>
<li> congestion window (cwnd) updates are now done as specified at Section 7.2.1,
     7.2.2 and 7.2.3 of RFC4960. Also the number of missing reports to trigger
     fast retransmits is reduced to three as specified in RFC4960.
</li>
<li> bug fix. A bug discovered by Eduardo Ribeiro and Igor Gavriloff regarding
     to memory deallocation is fixed.
<li> new validation tests for NR-SACKs and limited send buffer size are added to
     the test suite.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>ns-2.34 Released on June 17, 2009</h3>
<ul>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Sun Jun 14 10:30:00 2009:
<br> bugfix for 802.11Ext model (from Felix-Schmidt-Eisenlohr and team)
<ul>
<li> mac/wirelessPhyExt:
</li>
<ul>
<li> the power monitor class is responsible to continously track the sum of all reception power values of all frames arriving in parallel and of the noise floor. In the earlier implementation this cumulated power was only decreased in situations where no packet arrived. Otherwise, powers were always further summed up, leading to a wrong setting of this variable, and in consequence, a wrong behavior of physical packet reception calculations. Furthermore, the busy/idle signalling was not correct.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Wed Jan 14 22:20:00 2009:
<br> Add AOMDV (On-demand Multipath Distance Vector Routing in Ad Hoc Networks) implementation from Marcello Caleffi
</li>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Fri Jan 2 13:50:00  PST 2009:
<br> Collection of bug fixes for 802.11Ext model (from Felix-Schmidt-Eisenlohr and team)
<ul>
<li> mac/mac-802.11Ext:
<ul>
<li> feedback to higher layers on transmission failure: xmit_failure_data_ is delivered when a unicast packet was finally not sent successfully- corrected NAV update: in case a NAV is active and a new NAV is advertised an updated only occurs in case the new NAV takes longer than the one already running  - bugfix: corrected backoff handling when 0 backoff slots are selected:- bugfix: resolved memory leak on broadcast packet transmission- duplicate suppression support: reactivate the feature of duplicate detection on MAC layer as it was done in earlier versions
<li> code cleanup: removed TxTimer_t class
<li> bugfix: ACK frames: explicitly set basic modulation scheme
</ul>
<li>mac/wirelessPhyExt:
<ul>
<li> update of modulation table: new threshold values are taken for the different modulation schemes due to newer measurements
<li> bugfix: resched() instead of sched() in PowerMonitor::expire()
<li> code cleanup: removed friend class PowerTimer
<li> code cleanup: updated comment in recordPowerLevel()
<li> new implementation of PowerMonitor (PowerTimer class now obsolete)
<li> clarification of CSThresh variable (see below)
</ul>
<li> mac/channel.cc: for wirelessPhyExt only: correct calculation of distCST, using PowerMonitorThresh_ as the critical borderline power and including antenna gains.
<li> tools/ranvar.cc: - bugfix: resolved memory leak in Erlang distribution
</ul>
</li>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b> Sat Dec 13 15:20:00  PST 2008:

<h3>ns-2.31 Released on Mar 10, 2007</h3>
<ul>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b>Mon Jan 29 21:00:00 EST 2007:
<br>Several changes to WPAN module, contributed by Iyappan Ramachanran.
<ul>
<li> Ability to put a WPAN node to sleep has been added with appropriate actions to decrement energy in sleep state and in transitions. Appropriate code has been added to enable node sleep at any time that the user wishes from the tcl interface.
</li>
<li> The earlier implementation was indefinitely attempting transimission of a packet. This has been fixed; after backing of macMaxCSMABackoffs, a node just reports access failure to the upper layer.
</li>
<li> Owing to the lack of a detailed-enough PHY layer, CCA has to be done at one instant (the end of the 8th symbol, in the earlier implementation) instead of integration over 8 symbols. As this was leading to unrealistic behavior, CCA has been modified to be done at the end of the 4th symbol but reported to MAC at the end of the 8th.
</li>
<li> Code has been added to decrement appropritate energy in the carrier sensing process.
</li>
<li> The WirelessChannel::sendUp() function call by Phy802 15 4::PD DATA indication() causes receive energy to be decremented twice and has been fixed.
</li>
<li> Several other smaller bugs have been fixed.  
</li>
</ul>

<p><li><b>[mweigle]</b>Mon Nov 20 16:12:19 EST 2006:
<br>Significant change to PackMime-HTTP HTTP/1.1 behavior. This change
adds more flexibility in setting HTTP/1.1 behavior by separating out
random variables that control the number of pages per connection, the
number of objects per page, the time between objects, the time between
pages, etc.  Full details of the additions have been added to the ns
Manual chapter on PackMime-HTTP.
<br>Note: Results with HTTP/1.1 will change, but those with HTTP/1.0
will not. 
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>ns-2.30 Released on Sept 26, 2006</h3>
<ul>
<p><li><b>[tomh]</b>Fri June 23 07:25:00 PDT 2006: 
<br>Updated SCTP implementation; patch contributed by
<a href="mailto:iyengar@mail.eecis.udel.edu">Janardhan Iyengar</a>:
The Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) extension to SCTP has been added.
To use CMT, set useCmtReordering, useCmtCwnd and useCmtDelAck 1 at the
sender, and useCmtDelAck and useDelayedSacks to 1 at the receiver. You can
turn OFF the DAC algorithm by setting useCmtDelAck to 0 at both the sender
and the receiver. These variables will (hopefully) get consolidated by the
next release.

<p><li><b>[pradkin]</b> Tue May 30 14:32:21 PDT 2006
<br>Followup fix for baytcp (corrected sendpacket() signature).

<p><li><b>[pradkin]</b> Tue May 30 13:29:08 PDT 2006
<br>Major XCP cleanup:
<ul>
  <li>XCP plumbing changed to derive from tcp-classes instead of
  duplicating the code.
  <li>XCP header changed to using "X" (idealized inter-packet time)
  instead of source rate (throughput) to match NODIV-spec better.
  <li>XCP plugged into full-tcp (thanks, Amit!).
  <li>XCP: removed clutter of experimental mode spread_bytes_.
  <li>XCP: Removed clutter of experimental mode xcp_sparse_.
</ul>
<p>Modified test-suite-xcp.tcl to test XCP in full-tcp; disabled two
previously done tests; re-generated test output.
<p>Minor changes to TCP:
<ul>
  <li> Added extra parameter to FullTcpAgent::sendpacket() and made it virtual.
  <li> Made XcpEndsys friend of TcpAgent.
  <li> Made XcpSink friend of TcpSink.
  <li> Made ~TcpAgent() virtual as a matter of style.
  <li> A handful small changes to make compile.
</ul>

<p><li><b>[floyd]</b> Tue Mar 14 20:44:56 PST 2006
<br>TFRC change #1: Added idleFix_, default true, so that when the 
sender has been datalimited, the sender now doesn't let the
receive rate limit it to a sending rate less than the initial rate.
This applies during slow-start, during regular increases in the
sending rate, and after an idle period.

<p>TFRC change #2: Incorporated RFC3390 initial windows in more 
places, when RFC3390 initial sending rates are enabled.
If RFC3390 initial sending rates are enabled, then when reducing
the sending rate after an idle period, don't reduce the sending
rate below the initial sending rate.

<p>TFRC change #3:  Changed slowstart so that when the initial rate 
in pkts/RTT is greater than 1, the receive rate in the second report
is not used to limit the sending rate.  (This report is not of an 
entire RTT of data.)

<p><li><b>[mweigle]</b> Thu Feb  2 12:54:05 EST 2006:
<br>Adding DelayBox and PackMimeHTTP modules.  DelayBox provides
per-flow loss, delay, and/or bottleneck speed emulation for TCP
(one-way or FullTcp) flows. PackMimeHTTP is an HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
(persistent, but non-pipelined) traffic generator that uses FullTcp and
is based on the <a
href="http://stat.bell-labs.com/InternetTraffic/packmime.html">PackMime
Internet traffic model</a> developed at Bell Labs. <i>Note:</i>: Both of these 
modules use STL.
<p>Documentation has been added for both of these to the ns-manual,
validation scripts are in tcl/test/test-all-delaybox and
tcl/test/test-all-packmime and example scripts are in tcl/ex/delaybox/
and tcl/ex/packmime/
<p>In support of these modules, the following existing files have
been changed:
<ul>
 <li>common/packet.h - add the packet type PT_BLTRACE for the
 open-loop version of PackMime
 <li>tcp/tcp-full.{cc,h} - add closed_ = 0; close_on_empty_ = FALSE;
 to FullTcpAgent::reset() and moved reset() from protected to public
 to facilitate the re-use of TCP agents
 <li>tools/rng.h - add declarations for several random variables that
 are defined in packmime/packmime_HTTP_rng.cc. These are along the
 lines of lognormal(), pareto(), etc. that are already in rng.h.  We
 may want to move the definitions to rng.cc (like the others) at some
 point in the future.
 <li>tools/ranvar.{cc,h} - added the Weibull Random Variable
 (RandomVariable/Weibull)
</ul>

<p><li><b>[mweigle]</b> Mon Jan 30 16:19:41 EST 2006:
<br>Applied the bug fix for Mac/802_11 when RTS/CTS is not used, as
described in detail at 
<a href="http://www.dei.unipd.it/wdyn/?IDsezione=2435">http://www.dei.unipd.it/wdyn/?IDsezione=2435</a>.  This bug
fix is applied by default, but can be ignored with Mac/802_11
set bugFix_timer_ false

<li><b>[floyd]</b> Mon Jan 23 15:34:13 PST 2006:
Changed the default for TCP's precisionReduce_ to true,
for float rather than integer reductions in TCP's window.

<li><b>[floyd]</b> Mon Jan 23 15:34:13 PST 2006:
Changed the default for TCP's rtxcur_init_ from 6 seconds to 3 seconds,
to match RFC 2988.

<li><b>[floyd]</b> Fri Dec  2 21:34:26 PST 2005;
Added a parameter (use_mark_p_) to RED so that mark_p_ can be used
to explicitly control whether a packet is marked or dropped, even
when the average queue size exceeds maxthresh.
<li><b>[floyd]</b> Fri Dec  2 21:34:26 PST 2005;
Added a parameter (ecn_syn_) to TCP to allow SYN/ACK packets to be
ECN-Capable.  From a paper by Aleksandar Kuxmanovic.

retransmission is being sent to the same destination as the original
transmission
   <li> now anytime a tsn is newly acked (either by new cumack or

Added list-based improvement to ns-2. Code contributed by Valeri Naoumov (naoumov@inf.ethz.ch). The improvement involves maintaining a doubly-linked list to organise mobilenodes based on their X-coordinates. When sending a packet only those neighbor nodes are considered who are within a circle corresponding to the carrier-sense threshold energy level, below which a node cannot hear the packet. Improvement on original version where all nodes in topology is considered. considerable gain in run-time performance- goes down by about 4 to 20 times, depending on the size of the topology. The larger the topology and greater the no of nodes, greater the improvement seen with the list-based implementation. Pl see relevant papaer "simulation of large adhoc networks", appeared at MSWiM'03, san diego, USA for details.

Diffusion changes made includes
(1)Added tcl example scripts for 2 phase-pull, push, 1 phase-pull and gear (with push and 2pp) scenarios.
For gear and other node-position dependent routing in diffusion, need to have a callback to update node positions. since the routing filter (like gear) is init'ed before node positions are assigned gear doesn't get the correct node positions, hence the callback is required. callback would also be reqd to support node movements in diffusion in future.
For now start gear filters (in tcl scripts) after node positions are assigned to nodes. This will go away once callbacks are implemented.
(2)Added fix suggested by Andreas Koepke <tt>koepke@ee.tu-berlin.de</tt> for overflow problem in lib/main/tools.cc

<br> New Version numbering with this release [from Johnh]
As of this release we are changing the ns and nam version numbering
scheme from 2.1b10 (major.minor alpha/beta increment) to simply 2.26
(major.minor).  Unlike typical software that goes through well defined
cycles of alpha/beta development towards a release, different parts of
ns are at different levels of maturity.  For example, the TCP code is
quite mature, while the newest S-MAC code is still at an alpha stage.
Thus, the distinctions in the old numbering scheme were not useful.

We call the new release 2.26 because it's the 26th release in the ns-2
series.  Our hope is that this version will be less confusing than the
alternatives, and a clear shift in the version numbering scheme.
Similarly, the current nam release is nam-1.9.

Added oldCode_ for TFRC, for those who want to use the old code that
does not give good behavior with data-limited applications.
<p>
For the new code, added "datalimited_" to identify a data-limited
application, so that TFRC can send a packet immediately when new data  
becomes available from the application.  The old code always waited
for the next send timer to expire.
<p>
Also, when a timer expires saying that no status report has been
received from the receiver, the old code always halved the allowed 
sending rate.  The new code only halves the allowed sending rate
when a packet had been sent within the most recent two round-trip
times, or when the current rate was greater than four pkts per RTT.
Thus, in the new code, then the timer expires because no packets   
had been sent by the sender, the allowed sending rate is not reduced
below two packets per RTT.
<p> 
The validation test for these changes is "./test-all-quiescent"
in the directory tcl/test.

The default for numPkts_ is set to 3.

The warning about SMAC using sleep-wakeup cycles is about starting apps only after nodes sync which is about 40sec with the current default values (duty-cycle of 10%).

Adding support of FullTcp and variable packet size for RAMP
The major changes include:
1. Adding a callback function in FullTcp code, which allows
the sender to signal receiver that it has sent out all the data
in the buffer
2. Request and response data now is sent in bytes (previously it
is sent in packet)
3. When creating session, a CDF of segment size is used to enable
variable packet size for different TCP connections in the simulation
4. empweb now by default uses FullTcp (flags in empweb.tcl
are provided to switch back to use old TCP)

There are some original FullTcp bugs that I have not
figured out how to solve yet, will look into it later.
1. Even FullTcp allows sending data in both directions, it
assumes data only sends in one direction and ack sends
in the other. Hence you will see in the trace
file that some ACKs which are actually DATAs (you can tell
by the packet size)
2. the sequence number will mess up when both sides
are sending data using a single FullTcp connection

Bug fixes and changes made to mac-802.11. A special thanks to Gavin Holland<gholland@wins.hrl.com> for providing patches and support for the port.
Changes consis of the following bug fixes for the mac-802.11:

1. The new IEEEmac-802.11 -1999 std defines a separate PLCP (Physical 
Layer Convergence Protocol) layer and a corr. PLCP hdr and preamble 
(used for sync'ing between nodes etc); This PLCP is reqd to be tx'ed at a fixed rate of 1Mbps. Our older mac model lacked this feature.

2. The new std also states that all nodes in a network MUST use a data 
rate from a set of what is called the Basic data set, for tx'ing their 
control pkts (CTS, RTS and ACK). and they MAY choose a different data rate for tx'ing data pkts. This feature has been added.

3. There are some other bug fixes. one is the length of time the mac needs to wait before tx'ing a data pkt, which depends on whether 
CTS/RTS reservation is used or not etc. and it is something like

difs RTS sifs CTS sifs DATA sifs ACK
difs DATA sifs ACK

4. Pkt hdsr now have an additional field that have the txtime for that pkt. 

5. The energy calculation at wireless-phy is modified to reflect these changes.

to packets only from outgoing stacks of senders, causing all packets to suffer the same

receive packets corrupted differently based on their separation from the sender. 
Other than changing the name of options for corrupting packets, the usgae of these two
options are the same as the previous errProc in that the option value is the procedure
name creating a new error module that is inserted into the wireless stack. For the usage,

<br>Added an option "useHeaders_" to one-way TCP that takes into
account the TCP/IP header size in bytes when computing the size of
the packet to be transmitted on the wire.  The current default

<br>Added code from Wael Noureddine to deal robustly with outstanding
packets from the previous incarnation of a connection after a reset
(since there is no FIN_WAIT protection in one-way TCP).  This involves
adding a lastreset_ variable at the sender and sink that records
the time of the last reset.  Any ACKs/packets with timestamps that are
older than this time would be discarded at the sender/sink.
The validation tests are in ./test-all-tcpReset.

<br>Ported first-cut of Directed Diffusion (developed by SCADDS, USC/ISI) into ns.
All files related to diffusion can be found under ~ns/diffusion3.
All ns specific files can be found at ~ns /diffusion3/ns.

An example script can be found at ~ns/tcl/ex/simple-diffusion.tcl and it tests a simple 3 node topology where (1) all 3 nodes can hear each other and a source and sink apps pair is setup on two of the nodes. (2) where node0 and node2 donot hear eachother and communicated thru the third node1. src and skn apps reside on node 0 and node2.

**Note templates are used extensively and hence this code maynot be run in systems having compilers that donot support STL.

the first packet is 40 bytes, like a SYN packet, and the initial window

<br>The following modifications made to the routing code in NS: 1. In order
to increase run-time efficiency, we moved iteration-heavy parts of routing
from OTcl to C++. The classifier-population has been moved to C++ which
have resulted in run-time efficiency increase of more 50%. 2. Simulator
is now a split object. It manitains a list of node both in OTCl and C++.
will try to reduce it down to a single list: routing-modification partII.
3. Every node now maintains a pointer to the head of routing module chain.
so incase of a routing add/update, the info flows from head of the chain
to the other modules connected in the chain. same model should be there
in Otcl which will replace the routing module list maintained by each node.
--to-do-for-partII. 4. Population of classifiers now done by routing modules
entirely in C++. 5. A new ParentNode class added that acts as parent class
for different kinds of nodes like Node, LanNode, AbsLanNode, BroadcastNode
etc. 6. Wireless routing modules to be added in future --PartII.

<br>Partially completely node restructuring:
<ul>
<p><li>
A node can be considered as a collection of classifiers and routing modules.
An important function that Node should provide is how to interface classifiers
to routing modules. There are two aspects to this: (1) what is the organization
of these classifiers, and (2) when there is a routing change, which classifiers
should be notified and how.</li>

<p><li>
Hierarchical routing, manual routing, virtual classifier, MPLS have been
converted to the new scheme.</li>

<p><li>
Multicast code is partially converted, in that the hookup of switch_ is
done via RtModule/Mcast, however, existing mcast code is not changed to
be wrapped entired in this module; it is still in the forms of a bunch
of Simulator and Node instprocs.</li>

<p><li>
Mobile node and satellite node are not converted. Mobile code in itself
needs to be cleaned up. For instance, MobileNode partially duplicates the
functionality of MIP, however it does not entirely replace old Node/MIPBS
and Node/MIPMH. The conversion of these two modules to the new scheme also
requires changing their c++ code, which is not trivial.</li>
</ul>
Other changes include:
<ul>
<p><li>
Move AddrParams class to a singleton split object class. Most of its parameters
are now stored in c++ space.</li>

<p><li>
Created a wrapper hierarchical classifier to present a single classifier
interface to node configuration. This allows us to avoid those gazillions
of <tt>if [Simulator set EnableHierRt_] ...</tt> that were all over the
place.</li>
</ul>

<br>Added 'lsort -dictionary' to DV routing code so its results will not
change as the shadow object names of nodes change due to addition of new
objects. This paves the way to modular node configuration as some new node
routing modules would be added during the construction of each node. Also
changed is [array names] code in web cache, a lsort -dictionary will enhance
its validation stability.
<br>BTW I think SplitObjectCompare in tclcl/tcl-object.tcl is obsolete
now since 'lsort -dictionary' does the same job but it's built in hence
should be faster than an outside command.

<ol>
<p><li>
Added procedures into ns-packet.tcl to help customizing packet headers
in simulation. (Packet header chapter in ns manual has been updated; please
read it for more information.) This may lead to big savings in packet-intensive
applications. For instance, currently all protocol headers add up to about
2KB per packet, but including only the common header, IP header and TCP
header takes only about 100 bytes. This may mean a lot of savings for,
say, large-scale web traffic simulation. But I've not tested it.</li>

<p><li>
Get rid of all off_[hdr]_ stuff from all source files. Now ns-packet.tcl
does not create these offset variables at all. This saves two bounded variables
per NsObject.</li>

<p><li>
Move static packet header declaration from encap.h to encap.cc. A variable
_instantiation_ should not reside in a header file.</li>

Node cleanup: move all energy-related variables and methods in the base

<p><li>
Moved tcl/lib/rtProtoLS.tcl into tcl/rtglib, where all routing protocols

<br>Node cleanup: (1) moved nam tracing hookup to the base Node, so we
do not need to keep namtraceAllFile_ in Node, which duplicates that in

out unused otcl instprocs in Node which are masked (through inheritance)
by those in MobileNode.

<p><li>
Added MPLS package originally written by <a href="mailto:fog1@ce.cnu.ac.kr">Gaeil
Ahn</a>. It was modified to reduce the amount of otcl calls, and moved
to use node-config instead of creating a new Node subclass. However, there
is still a long way to go when a new routing module can be introduced into
a Node without interfering with other routing modules. Please see <a href="TODO.html">TODO.html</a>

<p><li>
Autoconf support for checking compatibility of compiler's STL support.
Basically it tries to see if template inheritance is supported, which some
earlier gcc does not seem so.</li>

<br>Currently this is used only for the link state routing protocol module,
which uses STL extensively. However, this mechanism can be easily extended
to enhance the modularity of ns, in the sense that the user may actively
choose which module to compile into her/his ns binary, thus save memory/disk
space/initialization time/etc.
<br><b>IMPORTANT</b>: validate is now moved to validate.in, because link
state module may or may not be present depending on availability of STL.
<p><li>
Removed numerous <tt>... set off_*_ 0</tt> in tcl/*/*.tcl. Although off_[hdr]_
is an obsolete way to access packet headers, it is still used in much existing
code. These offsets MUST be set through the code in tcl/lib/ns-packet.tcl.
Explicitly setting it to 0 will result in accessing packet header in the
wrong place. However, this is a very treachrous bug, because ns packet
header is 'sparse' in that much of the space is not used in a simulation.
Therefore, most of the time this bug will not lead to segmentation fault
or incorrect functionality. Usually it only results in mysterious segmentation
faults in completely irrerelevant places.</li>

<br>The most significant bug related to this problem is <tt>off_arp_</tt>
and <tt>off_sr_</tt>. The former results in the crash of <tt>wireless3</tt>
test in <tt>WLtutorial</tt> test suite. The latter results in incorrect
output of <tt>CMUTrace</tt> in dsr-related tests in <tt>wireless-lan</tt>,
<tt>wireless-lan-newnode</tt>,
and <tt>wireless-tdma</tt> test suites.
<p><li>
Merged all the <tt>delay_parse</tt>, <tt>time_parse</tt>, <tt>bw_parse</tt>
in tcl/*/*.tcl. There exists at least 3 versions of these codes with slightly
different implementations. Now they all converge to John's <tt>time_parse</tt>
and <tt>bw_parse</tt> in tcl/lib/ns-lib.tcl.</li>

<p><li>
test-output-wireless-lan/dsr.Z was truncated at the end because test-suite-wireless-lan.tcl
(and -lan-newnode.tcl) did not flush the trace file before rewriting it.</li>

information.</li>

<br>Replaced regular classifier with the hash classifier. This will improve
memory management because node addresses do not necessarily have to be
assigned sequentailly. A regular classifier allocates a static array whose
length is equal to the largest node address, which could cause various
problems, e.g., sparce array, running out of memory. A hash classifier,
on the other hand, allocates as many entries as there are nodes.

<br>Re-implement wiredLAN(802.3) by porting cmu's 802.3 module, and make
wiredLAN work again. Highlights:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) All 802.3 features including contention detection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are implemented in mac layer. (Old wiredLAN uses
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channel to detect contention)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Channel broadcasts packets to every nodes attached to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wiredLAN except the sender. It is up to mac layer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decide whether it receives or drops the packet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to the destination mac address of the packet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In old wiredLAN, channel does unicast by default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) WiredLAN uses the same structure as wireless LAN (from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom up, channel, phy, mac, ifq, ll, arp). These modules
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have the same function definition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) csma.cc is fully replaced by mac-802_3.cc
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) The reference output of wiredlan test suite have been
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) The nam packet flow of wiredlan test suite does not
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly reflect the packet sequences under ll. It is

<br>Changed default HTTP invalidation packet size, so that both unicast

<br>Previous ErrorModel won't work with ECN turned on if it is situated
after the QUEUE module. It's because ECN doesn't drop the packet, but an
event is scheduled to resume the handler from inside the ErrorModel instead
of from DelayLink. Added a check to avoid this. This will only affect scripts
using SimpleLink::insert-linkloss{} or Simulator::link-lossmodel{}.

<br>Many changes to FullTcp, including fixes to timestamps, re- structuring
of dupack actions, fix an off-by-1 problem for window deflation. Also,
changes for ECN [not yet fully tested] and addition of 5 new tests to test-suite-full.tcl.

<br>Changes to tcp-newreno.cc to make corrections in the interactions between
Fast Retransmit and ECN. I also added a new validation test, "test-all-tcpVariants",
to the ns "validate" test. It tests Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and Sack TCP
with one, two, three, and four packet drops. The validation test for ECN,
"test-all-ecn", is still in progress.

<br>Changes to tcp.cc, tcp-reno.cc, tcp-sack1.cc, and tcp.h, to make small
corrections in the interactions between Fast Retransmit and ECN, to avoid
some unnecessary reductions of the congestion window. The ECN validation
test "test-all-ecn" now documents the correct functioning of the Tahoe,
Reno, and Sack1 ECN code. In addition, the Fast Retransmit code has been
restructured, for readability. This is joint work with Kevin Fall.

says what to do with packets that shouldn't be handled specially. Classifiers
now have "findslot" fn which tells the slot# an object is in. Periodic
Error Model now has 'burstlen' parameter that provides for bursty periodic
losses, rather than just 1 pkt loss per period.

Revised the addressing format for ns as follows: Added API's for allocating
bits to address fields. Default value being 8 bits for port (2^8 agents)
and 7 bits for node address (2^7 nodes in a topology and 1 bit for mcast.
The API allows to set address for multilevel hierarchy (for hierarchical
routing), and expand the port bits to allow higher number of agents in
a node. For details see ~ns/tcl/lib/ns-address.tcl</li>

<p><li>
Added support for hierarchical routing.Currently hierarchical routing supports
upto 3 levels of hierarchy. The gt-itm to hierarchical converter - sgb2hierns,

<br>Some test suite work:
<ul>
<p><li>
validate: a new program in the top directory which runs all known test
suites.</li>

<p><li>
bin/fix_flow_id: sets flow-id to source/dest, or min of the two. The program
raw2xg graphs trace output, optionally putting different flows into ``bands''
(when invoked with -s 0.01 -m 90). It wasn't clear what the definition
of a ``flow'' was: was it the flow-id or the source? Kannan changed raw2xg
to use flow-id (the Right Thing---that's why we have flow-id, isn't it?).
This program (fix_flow_id) is the glue needed to map source or destination
into flow id for those scripts that prefer banding based on sources.</li>

<p><li>
test-suite-tcp.tcl was fixed to use fix_flow_id, making it work (it had
been broken since 22-Oct-97).</li>

<br>Several changes, including some bug fixes:
<ul>
<p><li>
Added a drop-from-front packet-drop policy to the RED and DropTail queue
classes. DropTail now has 2 kinds of dropping policies (drop-tail, of course;
and drop-front_) and RED has 3 (drop-tail_, which is the default; drop-rand_;
and drop-front_).</li>

<br>Files: drop-tail.{cc,h}, red.{cc,h}
<p><li>
TCP updates RTT from an ack only if no_ts_ flags is NOT set in packet header
(it's usually not set, unless there's an ack reconstructor en route, see
below). Also added TCP trace format control from Tcl, and derived TCP classes
can define their own trace function.</li>

<br>Files: tcp.{cc,h}
<p><li>
Added ack-recons.{cc,h} as a TCP ack reconstructor object (first cut).
Sits on other end of constrained reverse link and intersperses (reconstructs)
acks to the TCP source. Typically used in conjunction with schemes like
ack filtering for asymmet ric networks.</li>

<br>Files: ack-recons.{cc,h}, tcl/lib/ns-queue.tcl
<p><li>
Tracing tcp-asym-specific variables; controlling parameters from Tcl, fix

<ul>
<p><li>
The tcp-full.cc is updated to incorporate some of (but not yet all of)
the changes from Kathie Nichols/Van.</li>

<p><li>
the test-suite-full.tcl uses misc.tcl and topologies.tcl</li>

<p><li>
test-suite-full.tcl also uses 2 new tcl programs:</li>

<br>bin/tcpfull-summarize.tcl
<br>bin/cplot.tcl
<br>The first file grinds on {for now} full tcp traces and produces generic
output files containing traces of segments, acks w data, pure acks, and
drops.
<br>The cplot.tcl file is more generic, and takes a set of pairs of plot_file_names/labels,
plus a type of graphics program, and a title. It produces graphics using
either gnuplot or xgraph, where this decision is based on the assignment
of the "NSOUT" envariable.
<br>So, if you say "setenv NSOUT xgraph" and run test-all-full (or do some
other invocation of ./ns test-suite-full.tcl xxx), you will get xgraph
windows. If you set NSOUT to gnuplot, you will get x11 gnuplots in front
of you. Eventually I will extend this to produce postscript for inclusion
in documents; as it was sort of put together with extensibility in mind.</ul>

<br>TCP with integrated congestion control and loss recovery. This helps
to perform congestion control and loss recovery between communicating hosts
on a <i>per-host</i>, rather than <i>per-connection</i>, basis. This is
beneficial for Web-like workloads and in other situations where multiple,
logically different TCP transfers may be in progress between two hosts
simultaneously. With IntTcpAgent, these logically different connections
would share the same cwnd, srtt, etc. for better congestion control; in
addition, data-driven loss recovery is improved as well. Support for "proxy"
hosts, acting on behalf of many users, is also included.
<br>Files: tcp-int.{cc ,h} : Integrated TCP agent.
<br>chost.{cc,h} : Per-host congestion control and loss recovery. The relevant
TCP control block variables are maintained on w.r.t. each "Corresponding

time to real time when an external packet arrives.

<ul>
<p><li>
dynamics.tcl: rtModel/Manual did not work. Fixed, and tested. This code
is now used in tcl/ex/srm2.tcl and tcl/ex/srm_star.tcl to create ``interesting''
single packet drops.</li>

<p><li>
route-proto, RouteLogic::lookup would return OIDs when dynamic routing
is enabled, which breaks the multicast. (It now breaks when equal cost
multipath routing is used, which needs to be fixed, to make multicast happy).</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getrc [-o output file] [-b] -s node1 [-d node2] [trace file...]</pre>
Typically, all traffic from node1 is extracted. If -b is specified, then
all information to node1 is extracted as well. If both node1 and node2
are specified, then all traffic on the link between node1 and node2 is
extracted. Specifying the -b option will extract traffic in both directions

<ul>
<p><li>
Made changes to the scheduler (added <i>RealTimeScheduler</i>) to support
real-time simulation for emulated network envinroments. This real-time
extension works just like the normal scheduler but events are delayed until
real-time catches up. In particular, the scheduler "now" method returns
the current simulated time rather than the current real time so any simulation
CPU overhead is not reflected in event timing calculations.</li>

<p><li>
Added objects to interface to external networks. net.h, net.cc, and net-ip.cc
modules came from mash/mbone tools.</li>

<p><li>
Added hook in ns-lib.tcl to create tap header only if real-time scheduler
is specified. This avoids unnecessary waste of memory when not using tap
agents. We assume that taps and real-time schedulers are used in tandem
but haven't added any code to verify this.</li>

<br>Leveraged of the v2 test suites to construct routing test suites. The
list of mods are:
<ol>
<p><li>
A new test-suite driver, called ktest-all is in the bin directory. The
invocation</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ktest-all [&lt;suite&gt; [&lt;test&gt; [&lt;topology&gt;]]]</pre>
executes:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ns tcl/test/test-suite-&lt;suite&gt;.tcl &lt;test&gt; &lt;topology&gt;</pre>
If no test is specified, it runs all the tests in that suite. If no topology
is specified, it runs the specified test against all topologies defined
in the topologies file.
<p><li>
Any single test-suite file is now in three parts: (1) tcl/test/topologies.tcl
contains a library of topologies, and variants for netowrk dynamics. Currently
four topologies are defined. (2) tcl/test/misc.tcl contains the basic housekeeping
routines, such as openTrace, finish etc. (3) Individual tests are in tcl/test/test-suite-&lt;suite&gt;.tcl
files.</li>

<p><li>
The procedure <tt>finish</tt> in tcl/test/misc.tcl no longer directly invokes
xgraph. Instead, it simply writes out out.tr, closes all trace files, and
exists.</li>

<p><li>
ktest-all will invoke xgraph if the DISPLAY environment is defined; otherwise,
it will save the out.tr file as is in test-output-raw for later comparison;
in the latter case, it will also use gnuplot to generate a postscript file
that is placed in the ps-files directory.</li>

<p><li>
The bin directory also contains raw2xg and raw2gp, two programs to convert
trace files into output for xgraph or gnuplot. Convenient ways of invoking
either are:</li>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % raw2xg out.tr , xgraph -bb -tk -nl -m -x time -y packets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % raw2gp out.tr &gt; out.gp ; gnuplot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; load "out.gp"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...other gnuplot commands ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %</pre>
</ol>
There will be additional cleanup as I work on the test-suites some more.
Comments and suggestions are welcome.

<br>A number of additional changes to the packet format. Eliminated the

template that just defines the header size. Most of the packet-manager
functionality moved into ns-packet.tcl. Factored the flags field out of
ip6 into a separate hdr_flags struct. Eliminated old commented-out code
in a number of places. Created a "common" header (hdr_cmn) and moved the
size field from the ip header to the new common header. Also put the uid
here. Changed hdr_ipv6 to hdr_ip for consistency.

some other queue types need to be reset to compute functions of their Otcl-linked

<br>Another cut at packet format reorg. Eliminated the need for static
variables. Moved the accessor methods from the "Header" classes into the

of code in each module that ref'd a packet header (i.e., only needed to
change the pointer type of the variable that pointed at the packet header.)</ul>

<br>Add dynamics to links and nodes so that portions of the topology can
be made to fail and recover. The failure and recovery can be controlled
through distributions.
<br>Usage:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set ns [new Simulator]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ns rtmodel &lt;Distribution&gt; {&lt;up-time&gt; &lt;down-time&gt;} &lt;node1&gt; [&lt;node2&gt;]</pre>
A distribution (Distribution) can be specified either to a single node
(node1) or to a single link (between node1 and node2). The up-time (down-time)
is a parameter for the distribution to specify how long the specified node/link
will be up (down) before changing state to being down (up).

<br>Add dynamic routing to deal with topology changes (<i>work in progress</i>).
Currently, the basic all-pairs-spf routing has been modified to fit a more
uniform API. Also complete is a session-level routing, (<i>i.e.</i>, the
all-pairs-spf static routing used to precompute routes prior to starting
the simulation, and run everytime the topology changes).

MIT's <a href="ftp://ftp.tns.lcs.mit.edu/pub/otcl/README.html">Object Tcl</a>.
The TclClass C++ base class replaces the old Matcher class. An OTcl class

OTcl makes it easy to extend a class with new methods either on the C++
side or the Tcl side.</li>

to cwnd_/2 (before v1.0b2) or to min(cwnd_ + dupwnd_, wnd_)/2 (as in v1.0b2,3).</li>

<p><li>
Corrected calculation of congestion window for NewReno TCP for the case
when multiple packets are dropped from a single window of data.</li>

<p><li>
Fixed bug in tcp-sink.cc that allowed an infinite loop under some circumstances
when the number of outstanding packets in TCP was exactly MWS-1. Also added
a note to the man page about MWS and other constants in ns. Thanks to <a href="mailto:suter@big.att.com">Bernhard

<p><li>
Added the parameter "maxcwnd", for the maximum congestion window, and corrected
the use of "window", the receiver's advertised window, in the reno and
sack implementations of TCP.</li>

never to reset. Thanks to <a href="mailto:mahdavi@psc.edu">Jamshid Mahdavi</a>
for reporting both the bug and the fix.</li>

<p><li>

on each call (from the system clock) rather than once at start-up. Replaced
calls to random number routines with calls to Random::uniform. Thanks to
<a href="mailto:vogels@CS.Cornell.EDU">Werner
Vogels</a> for reporting this bug.</li>

<p><li>
Added local explicit-join notification for experimentation with RLM.</li>

<p><li>
Added a "message" agent that allows abibtrary message packets to be sent
and received using tcl.</li>

<p><li>
Moved type-specific packet fields into a "body" union. Eliminated "reason"
field (rather than move it to tcp body) since we should have just used
the "flags" field to begin with.</li>

<p><li>
Added tracing functionality to loss-monitor agents (e.g., so we can compute
sliding window loss statistics using an external tool).</li>

<p><li>
Changed ns-now to use 17 digits of precision. Otherwise, truncation could
cause certain algorithms (e.g., RLM) to try to schedule events into the
past.</li>

<p><li>
Added "random" attribute to cbr sources to cause them to generate a Poisson
rather than fixed-rate packet stream.</li>

<p><li>

Added source code for sack-tcp.cc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a15 Tue Dec 12 17:52:32 PST 1995</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
First cut at adding code for "tcp-sack1" and "sack1-tcp-sink", from Matt
Mathis (mathis@zippy.psc.edu) and Jamshid Mahdavi (mahdavi@psc.edu).</li>

<p><li>
Changed format of window and RTT reports sent from tcp.cc to the trace
file.</li>

<p><li>

<ul>
<p><li>
Finished port of TCP with selective acks, along with SACK acceptance tests
in "test-sack".</li>

<p><li>
Added a modified version of Reno TCP, tcp-newreno.cc, for research purposes.</li>

<p><li>

</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a13 Wed Nov 22 15:14:50 PST 1995</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
Finished port of cbq code from tcpsim (with contributions from Michael
Speer), and added cbq simulator tests.</li>

<p><li>
Added unique ID to each event in scheduler queue and added hook to lookup
an event by using this ID.</li>

<p><li>
Added hook for deleting <i>at</i> callbacks.</li>

<p><li>

<p><li>
First cut at port of TCP with selective acks.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a12 Sun Nov 5 21:19</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
Added config.h and loss-monitor.cc to FILES so they get included in tar.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a11 Sun Nov 5 21:19</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
Added loss-monitor agent, which is the same as a null-sink but calls a
tcl proc whenever there is a gap in the received sequence space. Will expand
functionality as necessary for MMG experiments.</li>

<p><li>
Integrated more mature tcl/c++ architecture from vic/vat. This has a major
impact on the way ns objects are created and deleted, but we maintain backward
compatibility with previous versions. The "ns" command is no longer implemented
in C++, but rather as a library function (in ns_default.tcl) that provides
glue between the old commands and the new "new/delete" interface.</li>

<p><li>
First cut at port of cbq code from tcpsim.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a10 Fri Oct 27 17:44:39 PDT 1995</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
Added "flush" method to trace objects so that output can be flushed before
exiting.</li>

<p><li>
Added link-level src/dst fields to Packet class so node can tell which
"interface" a packet arrived on.</li>

<p><li>
Added support for dense-mode PIM style flooding with prune/graft machinery.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>

Fixed Makefile.in to use V_LIB_TCL, as intended. Fix supplied by <a href="mailto:kannan@catarina.usc.edu">Kannan
Varadhan</a>.</li>

<p><li>
Ported to tcl-7.4.</li>

<p><li>
Include <a href="mailto:mathis@psc.edu">Matt Mathis'</a> test-all script.</li>

<p><li>
Changed "for" statement conventions to adhere to the proposed
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~mrs/wp-draft/stmt.html#stmt.for">ANSI
standard change</a> which re-defines the lexical scope semantics of the
initializer statement. In order to be compatible with both the old and
new semantics, we have changed all instances of</li>

<ul>
<p><li>
for (int i = ... ) ...</li>

<p><li>
use(i);</li>
</ul>
to
<ul>
<p><li>
int i;</li>

<p><li>
for (i = ... ) ...</li>

<p><li>
use(i);</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a4</h3>

<ul>

Fixed bug in xgraph output: new version of xgraph doesn't understand FileorDev
because it now uses the PRINTER environment variable. Bug fix from Matt
Mathis (mathis@psc.edu).</li>

Added a 'test-all' sh script to distribution, which runs whole suite of
regression tests and compares them against a reference output. Thanks to
Matt Mathis (mathis@psc.edu).</li>

<p><li>
Don't include tk.h from Tcl.cc.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>
v1.0a1 Mon Jul 31 16:05:08 PDT 1995</h3>

<ul>
<p><li>
Changed all references to random() to use Random class so we can easily
change our pseudo-random number generator.</li>

<p><li>
Added convention to object names so we can derive their type from their
name.</li>

<p><li>
Changed nodes to be first class objects like rest of objects.</li>

<p><li>
Changed trace syntax to use tcl files rather than it's own open/close.
For example,</li>

<ul>
<p><li>
set f1 [open out.hop w]</li>

<p><li>
$trace attach $f1</li>
</ul>

<p><li>
Changed '-' and 'd' trace records to have same format as '+' and 'h' trace
records.</li>

<p><li>
Incoporate vic's "matcher" abstraction into agent and link models.</li>

<p><li>
Major hacking to port tcpsim to tcl framework.</li>
</ul>
