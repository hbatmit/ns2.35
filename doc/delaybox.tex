\chapter{DelayBox: Per-Flow Delay and Loss}
\label{chap:delaybox}

DelayBox is an ns node that should be placed in between the source and
destination nodes. With Delaybox, packets from a TCP flow can be
delayed, dropped, and/or forced through a bottleneck link before being
passed on to the next node. A distribution can be used to specify
delay, loss, and/or bottleneck link speed for a source - destination
pair.  Each flow between that source - destination pair draws from the
distribution to determine its characteristics. Delays in DelayBox are
per-flow, rather than per-packet. Since DelayBox distinguishes between
flows, the {\tt fid\_} variable (flow identifier) should be set for
each flow in the simulation.  DelayBox can be used with both Tcp and
FullTcp agents.


\section{Implementation Details}

DelayBox maintains  two tables: a rule table and a flow table.  Entries
in the rule table are added by the user in the OTcl simulation script
and give an outline of how flows from a source to a destination should
be treated.  The fields are source, destination, delay Random Variable
(in ms), loss rate Random Variable (in fraction of packets dropped),
and bottleneck link speed Random Variable (in Mbps).  The bottleneck
link speed field is optional.  Entries in the flow table are created
internally and specify exactly how each flow should be handled.  Its
values are obtained by sampling from the distributions given in the
rule table.  The fields are source, destination, flow ID, delay, loss,
and bottleneck link speed .  Full-TCP flows are defined
as beginning at the receipt of the first SYN of a new flow ID and
ending after the sending of the first FIN.  Packets after the first
FIN are forwarded immediately (<i>i.e.</i>, they are neither delayed
nor dropped by DelayBox). For TcpAgent, flows are defined as beginning
at the receipt of the first 40 byte packet of a new flow ID.  Since
there are no FIN packets in TcpAgent, TcpAgent flows are never
considered finished nor are they removed from the flow table.

DelayBox also maintains a set of queues to handle delaying packets.
There is one queue per entry in the flow table.  These queues are
implemented as delta queues, in that the time to transfer the packet
is kept only for the head packet.  All other packets are stored with
the difference between the time they should be transferred and the
time the previous packet should be transferred.  The actual time the
previous packet should be transferred is stored in the variable {\tt
  deltasum\_}, named so because it is the sum of all delta values in
the queue (including the head packet's transfer time).  If the
bottleneck link speed has been specified for the flow, a processing
delay is computed for each packet by dividing the size of the packet
by the flow's bottleneck link speed.

When a packet is received, its transfer time (current time + delay) is
calculated.  (This transfer time is the time that the first bit of the
packet will begin transfer.  Packets that wait in the queue behind
this packet must be delayed by the amount of time to transfer all bits
of the packet over the bottleneck link.)  There are two scenarios to
consider in deciding how to set the packet's delta:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If the packet is due to be transferred before the last bit of
    the last packet in the queue, its delta (the time between transferring
   the previous packet and transferring this packet) is set to the
   previous packet's processing delay.  This packet has to queue
   behind the previous packet, but will be ready to be transmitted as
   soon as the previous packet has completed its transfer.
  \item If the packet is due to be transferred after the last bit of
    the last packet in the queue, its delta is difference between this
   packet's transfer time and the previous packet's transfer time.
\end{enumerate}

If the current packet is the only packet in the queue, DelayBox
schedules a timer for the receipt of the packet.  When this timer
expires, DelayBox will pass the packet on to the standard packet
forwarder for processing.  Once a packet has been passed up,
DelayBox will look for the next packet in the queue to be
processed and schedule a timer for its transfer. All packets, both
data and ACKs, are delayed in this manner.

Packets that should be dropped are neither queued nor passed on.  All
packets in a queue are from the same connection and are delayed
the same amount (except for delays due to packet size) and are
dropped with the same probability.  {\bf Note:} Drops at DelayBox are
not recorded in the trace-queue file.

\section{Example}
More examples are available in the {\tt tcl/ex/delaybox/} directory of the
ns source code.  The validation script {\tt test-suite-delaybox.tcl}
is in {\tt tcl/test/} and can be run with the command {\tt
test-all-delaybox} from that directory.
